# CG_DRR_3D_5D_python
Python version of Gui's modified 3D and 5D damped rank-reduction method

Since I found that DRR package (Pydrr, https://github.com/chenyk1990/pydrr) is hard to be pip install on windows, I present some minor revisions to directly use the DRR-python. You just put these packages and your target datasets in the same file path.

You can contact me (chenguicup@163.com) and we can have a further nice conversation for any questions afterwards!
