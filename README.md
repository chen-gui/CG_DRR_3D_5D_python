# CG_DRR_3D_5D_python
Python version of Chen Gui's modified 3D and 5D damped rank-reduction method (DRR, also known as DMSSA)

Since Yangkang Chen's DRR package (Pydrr, https://github.com/chenyk1990/pydrr) is hard to be pip install, I present some minor revisions to directly use the DRR-python. You just put these packages and your target datasets in the same file path.

Congratulations on seeing this code, you can use it directly!

Of course, if you use this code, you can contact me (E-mail: chenguicup@163.com) and we can have a further nice conversation for any questions afterwards!
